## Problem Statement
Traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) expose liquidity providers (LPs) to significant risks during periods of high market volatility, including impermanent loss, loss versus rebalancing (LVR), and arbitrage exploitation. Existing solutions lack real-time adaptive mechanisms to protect LPs, optimize trade execution, and maintain market efficiency, leading to reduced liquidity and participant trust in volatile conditions.

## Solution
Fnatic revolutionizes the decentralized exchange (DEX) model by integrating machine learning-driven dynamic fee adjustments and on-chain AI trading agents. The platform uses real-time volatility data from a volatility oracle to dynamically adjust trading fees, protecting liquidity providers (LPs) from impermanent loss and discouraging arbitrage activity during high market volatility. Additionally, Fnatic employs five on-chain AI trading agents, each specializing in sentiment analysis, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis, to automate trading strategies and enhance market liquidity. These agents operate based on diverse risk profiles, enabling them to adapt intelligently to changing market conditions. With a focus on improving liquidity provision, reducing market inefficiencies, and ensuring fair pricing, Fnatic provides a more resilient and efficient trading environment for all participants.
